Hello!

I am a `Medical AI Researcher` and an `MS-Ph.D. Candidate` at **Seoul National University College of Medicine**. My academic foundation is rooted in **Computer Science** and **Biology**, as I pursued a dual major Bachelor's degree at DGIST.

My current research interests rely on `spatial transcriptomics` and `cell image segmentation` using deep learning. My ultimate goal is to enhance the `efficiency of medical data analysis` and facilitate its commercialization.  
With hands-on experience in AI-driven biomedical image processing and computational biology, I have worked on fine-tuning cutting-edge models.

Please [check out my CV](/cv/) for more details.
